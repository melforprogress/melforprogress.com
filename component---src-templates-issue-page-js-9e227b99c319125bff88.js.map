That’s why Mel supports funding experiments in Universal Basic Income which would provide support as the nature of work is redefined. As a stay-at-home parent Mel knows first-hand that caretaking is an uncompensated full-time job essential to the health of our economy and society. Caretaking is meaningful labor, and should be recognized as such.

But it’s not just about throwing money at the problem, it’s about identifying successful outcomes and investing in the people that ensure them. From increasing teacher pay, to free childcare, Mel recognizes that educational outcomes are not just about schools, they are also dependent on the ability of working-class people to provide for their families and build a good life. The ability of working-class families to live the lives they deserve has been sacrificed in favor of tax breaks for the wealthy, and disinvestment in our public schools is part of that same trend.`),\n      oneLine(`Teachers have gone on strike across the country, rallying for a deeper investment in public education. These are teachers who are underpaid, overworked, and paying for needed school supplies out of their own pockets because our country places too little value on their work and on the well-being of the children that they are educating. In 2019, we continue to see segregation in our K–12 schools, and with students of color and students in underserved areas suffering as a result.

However, that bill still languishes in Congress despite studies that show access to higher education while incarcerated leads to lower recidivism rates and improved outcomes for impacted individuals and their families.

However, the rate of incarceration for women has actually been increasing nationwide. In New York, while the rate for women has been slowly declining, it has not kept pace with the reduction of rates for men. Many women who find themselves in the system are victims of domestic abuse and prison furthers that trauma. Our jails and prisons are not mental health or counseling facilities. Mel believes the federal government must invest in diversion programs for all, but especially for women who have fewer options available to them, and that they are provided with appropriate trauma informed services.`),\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    title: 'Repealing SESTA-FOSTA',\n    id: 'SESTA',\n    bugurl: SESTA_bug,\n    text: [\n      oneLine(`Another priority for Mel is the repeal of SESTA-FOSTA.

Legalized marijuana revenue should be reinvested in the communities that have been most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs and racist broken windows policing. African-Americans are four times as likely to get arrested for marijuana as white Americans, despite both populations having similar rates of marijuana use. This has been a tool of mass incarceration, and a boon to the prison industrial complex. Corporations have profited off of the destruction of lives and communities through the criminalization of marijuana, and are now looking to profit off of its legalization.

The current administration’s assault on the LGBTQIA community is unacceptable. LGBTQIA people are still forced to fight for their rights in their towns, in congress, and in their day to day lives because they lack basic legal protections in states across the country. Federal law must provide consistent non-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
