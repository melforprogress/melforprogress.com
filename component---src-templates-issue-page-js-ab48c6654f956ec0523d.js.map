That’s why Mel supports funding experiments in Universal Basic Income which would provide support as the nature of work is redefined. As a stay-at-home parent Mel knows first-hand that caretaking is an uncompensated full-time job essential to the health of our economy and society. Caretaking is meaningful labor, and should be recognized as such.

From increasing teacher pay, to free childcare, Mel recognizes that educational outcomes are not just about schools, they are also dependent on the ability of working-class people to provide for their families and build a good life. The ability of working-class families to live the lives they deserve has been sacrificed in favor of tax breaks for the wealthy, and disinvestment in our public schools is part of that same trend.`),\n      oneLine(`Teachers have gone on strike across the country, rallying for a deeper investment in public education. These are teachers who are underpaid, overworked, and paying for needed school supplies out of their own pockets because our country places too little value on their work and on the well-being of the children that they are educating. In 2019, we continue to see segregation in our K–12 schools, and with students of color and students in underserved areas suffering as a result.
