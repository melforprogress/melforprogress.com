            housing should be a national priority. While an improving economy has benefited real 
            estate and land development corporations, wages are not keeping up with rising housing 
            prices and rent. In Queens alone, countless working families are being priced out of 
            their neighborhoods, and the number of people experiencing homelessness is increasing. 
            When the scales are tipped in favor of wealthy developers, a new vision for social housing 
            in America is necessary. Expanding on the recommendations of the Peopleâ€™s Policy Project, 
            Mel will introduce legislation to create 25 million new environmentally sustainable social 
            housing units by 2050, and create affordable housing for all.`),

            individuals. Furthermore, Mel will ensure that this legislation provides employment
